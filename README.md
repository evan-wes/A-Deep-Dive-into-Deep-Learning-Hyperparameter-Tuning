# UCI_CoverType_Deep_Learning

Project using neural networks constructed with TensorFlow and Keras to predict forest coverage type based on data on soil samples.

This project uses the full dataset hosted on the UCI machine learning repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)

The primary goal of this project is to develop strategies for tuning the large number of parameters and hyperparameters controlling various aspects of neural network construction and training.

 - Neural networks

Primary python libraries used:
 - Visualizations:
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`

   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`

 - Neural networks:
   - `tensorflow`
   - `keras` 

 - Model performance analysis:
   - `sklearn`
